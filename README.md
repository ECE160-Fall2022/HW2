# ECE160 - HW#2

Due 09/17/22 at 11:59PM.  
Late submissions are subject to a 20% late penalty.

## Reading
The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition - Kerninghan & Ritchie  
Chapter 2.6-2.12, 3.1-3.3, 1.5

## Instructions

You may work individually or in a pair for all assignments. If you do so, make sure that each member of the pair submits an answer to at least 1 question.

For each question, you will be submitting the homework via Github pull requests, just like how the industry submits code for review. 

Please follow the instructions carefully. Note: failure to do so will result in a reduction of 20% of this homework grade. If you make a mistake, you can always delete the entire repo and try again (but of course, save your code).  
1. Go to the github classrooms link provided.  
2. Create a team (individual or a pair).  
3. Clone the repository to your unix environment and create a separate submission branch. If you're working in a pair, you may work on the same branch or on separate branches. But when submitting your homework, please consolidate your submission into 1 branch.
4. For each question, put your solution in that directory with the following naming convention: q#.sh or q#.c or q#.py depending on the language. Don't forget to update the README to document how to run the program and the output.
5. Push your submission branch to the repo.
6. Create a pull request against the master. **Do not merge to master as it will prevent anyone from giving you a review or comments**

For all questions, you must do the following:
* Submit compile-able code
* Edit the README.md with the compilation steps (even if it is just one line)
* Edit the README.md to have the output of the program.

## Grading
